# Databricks Spark 3.0 ceritification
Prep for the databricks spark 3 certification using Learning Spark v2 book resource
Sample datasets have been taken from the databricks community edition storage.

The repo covers the practical aspects of dataframe api including the following:

* Subsetting DataFrames (select, filter, etc.)
* Column manipulation (casting, creating columns, manipulating existing columns, complex column types)
* String manipulation (Splitting strings, regex)
* Reading/writing DataFrames (schemas, formats- parquet, avro, json etc)
* Rows, Columns and Expressions
* Common Dataframe operations (filter, select, where, distinct, sort, limit)
* Wide and Narrow Transformations
* Working with dates (extraction, formatting, etc)
* Aggregations (groupBy, orderBy, count)
* Statistical methods (avg, sum, max, min, describe, correlation, sampleBy)
* UDFs 
* Combining datasets (joins, unions, broadcasting)
* Optimising and tuning (caching and persistence, repartitioning, shuffle, catalyst optimiser - logical, optimised plans)

In addition, there is also an example of mlflow pipeline although not part of the certification
